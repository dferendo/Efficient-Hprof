1) Ask about native methods regarding exceptions? Answer  If the exception is caught in a Java programming language method, the event is generated when the catch clause is reached. If the exception is caught in a native method, the event is generated as soon as control is returned to a Java programming language method.

2) Exceptions are not triggering events? Answer: event callback was off

3) How to get the current method with jMethodId from exceptions? Maybe loop through the whole table and get the method which contains the same jmethodID??? (Dunno know how).

   Methods tried: Looping through the tables was not correct since jmethodID is NULL for most of the classes.  
   Methods tried: Use JVMTI https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#GetMethodName.

3) Benchmarking: Registering in progress with AWS.

4) Documentation.

5) How to link object table with the tree.

6) Correctness evaluation.
